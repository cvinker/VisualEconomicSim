- # Programming Requirements for Economic Simulation Project

## `agents.py`
This module is tasked with the creation and management of economic agents within the simulation.

### Classes:
- **Consumer**
- **Corporation**
- **Government**

### Key Functionalities:
- **Attributes:** Define attributes such as wealth, consumption preferences, investment capabilities, policy-making powers.
- **Methods:**
  - `spend()`: Dictate how agents distribute resources for consumption.
  - `save()`: Outline the saving behavior.
  - `invest()`: How and what agents invest in.
  - `pay_taxes()`: Interaction with the government through tax payments.
- **Decision-making:**
  - Implement simple AI or rule-based logic to allow agents to make economic decisions based on their state and market conditions.
- **Initialization:**
  - Initialize agents with specific parameters or default settings to simulate diverse economic scenarios.
- **Data Export:**
  - Methods to log and export each agent's state for analysis and visualization.

## `market.py`
This module simulates the economic market where agents interact, trade, and are influenced by various factors.

### Key Functionalities:
- **Trade Mechanisms:**
  - `trade_goods()`: Enable buying and selling interactions among agents.
  - `set_prices()`: Adjust prices based on market dynamics of demand and supply.
- **Market Indicators:**
  - `calculate_equilibrium()`: Evaluate and adjust market equilibriums.
  - `track_inflation()`: Monitor and calculate inflation rates.
- **Regulations and Events:**
  - `apply_regulations()`: Simulate how government policies impact market operations.
  - `simulate_event()`: Handle market responses to economic events such as downturns or booms.

## `analysis.py`
Responsible for collecting, processing, and presenting data generated from the simulation.

### Key Functionalities:
- **Data Accumulation:**
  - Implement structures to efficiently collect, store, and process simulation data.
- **Statistical Tools:**
  - Provide functions for basic statistical analysis to evaluate the health of the simulation economy.
- **Economic Indicators:**
  - Compute and report key metrics such as GDP and unemployment rates.
- **Report Generation:**
  - Automated generation of reports detailing simulation outcomes and trends.
- **Predictive Analysis (Optional):**
  - Use machine learning techniques to predict future economic conditions based on historical and simulated data.

These are the programming requirements detailed for each specific module involved in the Economic Simulation Project. Developers are expected to rigorously implement these functionalities to ensure the simulation's effectiveness and accuracy.
