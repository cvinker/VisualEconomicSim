# Economic Simulation Project

## Overview
This project aims to simulate the economic interactions within a country, capturing the dynamics between various agents such as consumers, corporations, and government entities. The simulation will provide insights through interactive visualizations of economic data and results.

## Objective
- To create a robust simulation of economic activities within a simulated environment.
- To visualize the economic impact of different agents and their interactions in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Main programming language for simulation.
- **NumPy & Pandas:** For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly:** For creating interactive and static visualizations.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch (Optional):** For integrating machine learning components if required.
